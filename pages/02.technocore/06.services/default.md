title: 'Supported Services'

These pages contain the links I thought were helpful when configuring and operating the supported services. They are primarily links to other documentation, guides, and other artifacts with occasional notes. 

If you're interested in knowing how a service works in within the SciFi Farms context, checkout [Working with Seedships](../seedships/) instead.
